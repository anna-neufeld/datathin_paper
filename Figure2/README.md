The file "samp_split_random_X.R" runs the experiment to compare sample splitting and data thinning in the large n and random X setting. 

The file "samp_split_fixed_X.R" runs the experiment to compare sample splitting and data thinning in the small n and fixed X setting. 

The results from each file above are saved as .RData objects to facilitate fast analysis in the future. 

The file "make_plot.R" consolidates results from those two files to make Figure 2.
